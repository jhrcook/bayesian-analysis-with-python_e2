This repository contains by notes on the book [*Bayesian Analysis with Python* (2e)](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python-second-edition) by Osvaldo Martin.
I have a good understanding of the basics of Bayesian analysis after working through Richard McElreath's [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) (my [notes](https://github.com/jhrcook/statistical-rethinking)), and I want to get more practice using Python and Bayesian analysis techniques.
This book should serve as a strong introduction to the [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io) library and provide another perspective on conducting Bayesian data analysis.
